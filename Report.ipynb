    "The process of precisely recognize people by ears also has been getting major attention in recent years. It represents an important step in the biometric research, especially as a complement to face recognition systems which have difficulty in real conditions. This is due to the great variation in shapes, variable lighting conditions, and the changing profile shape which is a planar representation of a complex object. We present an ear recognition system involving a convolutional neural network (CNN)  to identify a person given an input image.\n",

Four images are given, we for ears “in the wild” (there is no constraint in the way of taking the photo), two for ear images taken with a “donut device” that serves as a background and somewhat controls lighting.  There are 4*195(individual ear) in the dataset.\n",
